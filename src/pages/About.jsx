            <p>Magic Unicorn Unconventional Technology & Stuff Inc. was born from a sparkâ€”an idea ignited by Aaron Stransky, polymath, Unconventional Technologist, and (reluctantly titled) CEO. With over 20 years of expertise in defense systems, AI innovation, and government automation, Aaron saw a gap in the industry: a need for tech that's powerful, accessible, and delightfully unconventional.</p>
            <p>While others lagged behindâ€”locked into cloud silos and clunky interfacesâ€”Aaron was already building modular AI pipelines, running local inference, and championing open-source as the foundation for a freer, smarter future.</p>
            <p>Magic Unicorn is the embodiment of that vision: a company that's as imaginative as it is impactful, delivering boundary-pushing solutions with creativity, community, and a sprinkle of unicorn magic. ðŸ¦„âœ¨</p>

              <p>Before Magic Unicorn became a name in AI, we were building immersive environments: custom furniture with hidden LED lighting, residential setups that transformed into party-ready wonderlands, and large-scale installations like hospital video walls and full club sound systems.</p>
              <p>These weren't side gigsâ€”they were strategic stepping stones. They funded our growth, sharpened our capabilities, and kept our creative flame lit while the AI world caught up.</p>
              <p>From dance floor glows to server rack hums, every project was a signal flare pointing toward the future. When the tech aligned, we pivoted fully to AIâ€”and haven't looked back. (Though for the right boundary-pushing buildâ€¦ we might still light up a space. Literally.)</p>
